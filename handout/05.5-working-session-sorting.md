# Part 5 Exercises

## ng-repeat and sorting

Let's use `ng-repeat`'s `orderBy` feature to make our task list sortable
by owner.

In `index.html`, we can statically sort the task list by owner by changing the
`ng-repeat` expression to the following:

```html
<th ng-repeat="task in taskList.tasks | orderBy:'owner'">
```

The `orderBy` filter takes as parameters:

1. an expression evaluating to the name of the property to sort on
2. an optional boolean parameter specifying whether it's a descending sort or
not.

```
orderBy_expression | orderBy : propName : reverse
```

So, we can also make it sort in reverse order using the following:

```html
<th ng-repeat="task in taskList.tasks | orderBy:'owner':true">
```

### Exercise 1:

Let's see if we can implement a feature where clicking on the 'owner' header
will switch between ascending and descending sort.  Some hints:

1. You'll need to bind the `reverse` portion of the `orderBy` expression to a
  variable in your `TaskListController`
2. You'll also need to add a link to the 'Owner' header, and use `ng-click` to
  manipulate your new variable.

### Exercise 2:

Let's make the description column sortable too.  This will involve binding the
`propName` portion of the filter expression to a controller variable as well.
